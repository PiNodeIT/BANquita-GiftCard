# BANquita Python GiftCard Generator

This is a Python scrypt to generate banquita-themed BANANO giftcards 

## How to generate a seed/address pair

  ### if you do not want the script to generate the seed/address pair:
    - Go to https://nanoo.tools/quick-banano-account

    - Click Random Seed

Now you have the seed and the address.

- The seed must be entered when prompted by the banquita-gift script to put the seed into the GiftCard
- The public address is the address to send the ban to load the giftcard


Seed generation and banquita-gift script execution can be performed <u>offline</u> **<u>(for security reasons offline execution is strongly recommended)</u>**

  ### if you are comfortable with letting the script generate the seed/address pair:
    - select [Y] when prompted

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
  - Qrcode lib
  - os lib
  - Base64 lib
  - Image from Pillow lib
  
### Installation

install the requirements

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage instructions 

Clone the repo or download it
Once you start the script it will ask you to enter the SEED , the DEPOSIT address and finally a name you want to give the file (without extension) 
That's it.
The resulting GiftCard are saved in the "GiftCard" folder (it wil be created if not exist in the same path of the script)  

Inside the "GiftCard" folder  you will find 2 file :
  - (name)_GiftCard.png is the giftcard
  - (name)_Deposit.png is the deposit address qrcode (to put some BAN in the giftcard)

### Final comments

I know the scrypt could be much more elegant and functional than this, unfortunately I'm not a programming expert, so **feel free to improve it**
